Scenario Beta: Data Processing Pipeline
Problem: Process different file formats (CSV, JSON, XML) with the same workflow (read, parse, save) but varying implementations.
Design Pattern: Strategy Pattern
Encapsulates specific file processing logic (CSV, JSON, XML) into interchangeable strategies.
Allows easy addition of new file types without modifying the core workflow.
